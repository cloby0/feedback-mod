/**
 * A piece of bent metal that snaps over at one temperature.
 *
 * <h2>Why there is no controller in this slice</h2>
 * Beat 2 has exactly one condition to watch, and a single condition needs no logic. Putting a
 * programmable controller here would waste it -- and worse, it would teach the player that
 * automation means programming, when the thing they actually need to learn first is that
 * automation means <em>closing a loop</em>. A strip wired to a clutch is a thermostat, and it
 * closes the loop with no logic block anywhere.
 * <p>
 * Slice 2's controller then arrives at the moment §13 says it should: when one condition stops
 * being enough, because a bellows and a damper are two actuators and two conditions and a strip
 * cannot express that. It <em>replaces</em> the strip rather than appearing beside it.
 *
 * <h2>It has no setting, and that is the design</h2>
 * Philosophy 3. The trip point is where this strip's two metals say it is. Wanting a different one
 * means crafting a different strip, which is how the family grows -- and it is why the strip never
 * becomes the thing a player tunes their way out of a problem with.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing in the system knows that 1425 Tu matters</h2>
 * The firebox does not, the bellows does not, the crucible does not, and the thermometer certainly
 * does not. The player built the only thing that knows (§8), out of a part they chose because of
 * what it trips at. That is the whole of what automation is in this mod.
 *
 * <h2>The bug it ships with is the lesson</h2>
 * The loop overshoots, and it is meant to. A small crucible climbs at roughly 8 Tu/t under air, so
 * by the time this has snapped over and the clutch has let go, the vessel has sailed past the
 * window. Good enough information, and still unable to hold the condition -- philosophy 8's second
 * half delivered as a bug the player fixes rather than a paragraph they read. Every available fix
 * is physical (§4): a bigger vessel, more insulation, a shorter throw on the bellows, or a gear
 * train that strokes it less often.

     * make the loop tighter than any physical part could be -- which would quietly remove the
     * problem this block exists to hand the player. Response time is one of §8's six apparatus
