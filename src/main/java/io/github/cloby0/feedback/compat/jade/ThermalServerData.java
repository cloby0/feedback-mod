/**
 * Sends the truth about a thermal block to the client so the HUD can describe it.
 *
 * <h2>Same argument as {@link RotationServerData}</h2>
 * A crucible syncs its temperature only when its contents change, because syncing a float sixty
 * times a second to every nearby client so a HUD can round it to a word would be absurd. That
 * makes the client's copy stale by up to a whole process, which adjectives would survive and the
 * debug helmet would not -- and §8 permits an instrument to be wrong but never to overstate its
 * certainty. So the live figure is fetched on demand for the one block being looked at.
 * <p>
 * Note the {@code READABLE} flag. A sealed vessel refuses to be read at all, and the HUD must
 * distinguish <em>this is not measurable</em> from <em>this is cold</em>. That distinction is the
 * wall the whole beat is built around, so it would be a poor thing to lose in a tooltip.
