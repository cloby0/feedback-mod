/**
 * The client's copy of the deformation table, kept only so a recipe browser can print it.
 *
 * <h2>Why a copy exists at all</h2>
 * {@link DeformationTable} is datapack data and therefore server-side; philosophy 8 nonetheless
 * says a <em>requirement</em> is free and exact, which means the figures have to reach the browser
 * somehow. So the server ships the table on datapack sync and this holds it.
 * <p>
 * Nothing here participates in the simulation. The hammer never reads this, and no outcome is ever
 * computed from it -- it is a printed handbook, not a second source of truth.
 *
 * <h2>The listener</h2>
 * JEI has to be told when the table arrives, but this class must not import JEI: it is loaded even
 * when JEI is absent. So the dependency runs the other way -- the JEI plugin leaves a callback
 * here, and an absent JEI simply never leaves one.
