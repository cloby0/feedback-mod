/**
 * Throwing hot metal in water.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is an event on a dropped item and not a machine</h2>
 * Because that is what quenching is. There was a version of this with a quench tank block in it,
 * and the tank added nothing except a place to stand -- the interesting decision is entirely in
 * <em>whether the ingot is still hot enough when it lands</em>, and that decision is the walk
 * from the crucible, which already exists. A block would have been a container for a mechanic
 * that does not need one, and philosophy 3 cuts mechanics that are real, well-precedented and
 * have no choice inside them.
 * <p>
 * The consequence is better than the block would have been: the player quenches by throwing the
 * ingot, anywhere, into any water. It is the most physical action in the mod and it needed no
 * machinery at all.
 *
 * <h2>What it teaches</h2>
 * The same ingot at the same final temperature is a different item depending on how it got there.
 * Nothing about the end state distinguishes the two. That is philosophy 7's history-sensitivity
 * and the first requirement in the slice that cannot be satisfied by getting a number right --
 * and it is real metallurgy, which is the point of §2: the mod did not invent this rule, it
 * noticed it.
 * <p>
 * Missing the window costs nothing but the trip. A cold ingot in water is a cold ingot.
