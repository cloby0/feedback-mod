/**
 * Perfect instrumentation, which is the one thing philosophy 8 says a player may never buy.
 *
 * <h2>What it is for</h2>
 * Every readout in the mod is an adjective until an instrument says otherwise. That is the design,
 * and it makes the mod almost impossible to <em>develop</em>: there is no honest way to ask a shaft
 * what it is really doing. Sneak-clicking each block printed the answer to chat, which worked and
 * was six copies of the same code scattered across five blocks.
 * <p>
 * This replaces all of it. Wear it and every qualitative readout -- Jade lines, the workpiece
 * tooltip -- turns into the figure the simulation actually holds. It is a cheat, deliberately, and
 * it is shaped like one: creative-only, out of the mod's creative tab, obtainable only by somebody
 * who already knows it exists.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is not a thermometer</h2>
 * Instruments are a real progression axis (§8: range, resolution, accuracy, response). This is not
 * the top of that ladder and must never be allowed to read as it -- an instrument with infinite
 * accuracy and no cost is not a better instrument, it is the absence of the mechanic. Keeping it
 * out of the creative tab is what stops it being mistaken for tier five.
 *
 * <h2>Implementing Equipable rather than extending ArmorItem</h2>
 * {@link Equipable} is what actually decides where a stack goes and gives the right-click swap for
 * free. ArmorItem would additionally demand a registered armour material and an armour-layer
 * texture, and would then render a missing-texture helmet on the player -- all to describe an item
 * that provides no protection and should be invisible anyway.
