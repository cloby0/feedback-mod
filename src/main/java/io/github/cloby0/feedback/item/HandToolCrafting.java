/**
 * Hand work makes a noise.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is worth a class</h2>
 * Philosophy 8: the player's own senses are free, and the mod leans on that everywhere else -- a
 * labouring rotation network smokes and creaks at its sources, a quench hisses, a hammer clangs on
 * the anvil. Hand work was the one operation in the mod that happened in total silence, which made
 * a crafting grid feel like a menu rather than like the same blow the machine lands. It is the same
 * blow. It should sound like it.
 *
 * <p>It gives away nothing. A noise is an adjective -- it says <em>that happened</em> and names no
 * figure -- so it sits on the free side of §8's line alongside the smoke and the creak.
 *
 * <h2>Why an event and not the item</h2>
 * GregTech plays its tool sound inside {@code getCraftingRemainingItem}, which works but hides a
 * side effect in a getter that both logical sides call. {@code ItemCraftedEvent} is the honest
 * place: it fires once, when a craft actually happens, and it hands over the grid to look at.
 *
 * <h2>One clang per tick, and why that is the right number</h2>
 * Shift-clicking a stack crafts the whole thing in a single tick, so an untroubled implementation
 * fires sixty-four sounds at once and produces a noise like a dropped filing cabinet. Throttling to
 * one per player per tick collapses that into a single sharp report, while ordinary one-at-a-time
 * crafting still clangs every time -- which is exactly the distinction worth hearing, because
 * shift-click is the gesture that runs a stack past a plate into scrap.
