/**
 * Ships the deformation table to the client so a recipe browser can print it.
 *
 * <h2>Why a packet rather than JEI's own hooks</h2>
 * Both were available and the packet wins on honesty. The table is datapack data, so the client
 * genuinely does not have it -- that is a missing-data problem, not a JEI problem, and solving it
 * in JEI would mean any other display we ever write has to solve it again. Sending it once on
 * datapack sync leaves a plain list any consumer can read, and JEI becomes an optional reader of
 * it rather than the owner of it.
 * <p>
 * It also keeps the deletion story simple: if JEI is not installed, this packet still arrives and
 * costs three entries of memory.
