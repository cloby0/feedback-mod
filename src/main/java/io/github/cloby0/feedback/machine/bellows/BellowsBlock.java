 * The same choice the Timer made about what it switches. Beat 2 has no data links and should not
 * pretend to, so the wiring stays visible: a player can see what a bellows feeds by looking at
 * what it is bolted to. A facing property would add a placement rule the placeholder art cannot
 * show, which is the mistake the cogs' meshing rule already avoided once.
