/**
 * Turns rotation through a corner. Four bevels on a common crown, in a box.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a separate block from a cog</h2>
 * Cogs change speed; the gearbox changes <em>axis</em>, at 1:1. Keeping them apart means neither
 * block does two jobs, and it is the honest split: a gear train is how you buy force, and a
 * gearbox is how you get power round a wall. Wanting both means placing both.
 *
 * <h2>Direction, and why it is not free to choose</h2>
 * Every shaft the box couples runs off the same crown, so which way each one turns is fixed by
 * geometry rather than by preference: shafts on opposite faces turn against each other, the way
 * the two halves of a differential do, and perpendicular shafts agree or disagree depending on
 * which corner they sit at. There is no consistent rule where every turn reverses -- the three
 * axis pairs cannot all be negative at once -- so the signs are taken from the face's own axis
 * direction, which is consistent by construction and reverses exactly the pairs that are opposite.
 * <p>
 * Getting direction right is therefore a placement problem, which is the intent. The gearbox has
 * no setting on it, per philosophy §3, and the player who needs the other direction adds a cog.
