/**
 * Squeezes. That is the entire device.
 *
 * <h2>It has no target and no thermometer</h2>
 * Given strokes it moves air; given none it stops. It cannot be told a temperature, it cannot read
 * one, and it is not {@link io.github.cloby0.feedback.control.Switchable} -- stopping it means
 * stopping the shaft that drives it, which is what the clutch is for. That is philosophy 10 taken
 * literally: measurement, control and actuation are three separate systems, and the player is the
 * one who wires them together.
 * <p>
 * It is also the slice's <b>only</b> actuator, and it points one way. Nothing removes heat.
 * Overshoot the window and there is nothing to do but wait, on a vessel chosen for stability and
 * therefore equally stubborn about coming back down. The player cannot ask for cooling; they can
 * only stop asking for heat. Slice 2's damper is earned by withholding it.
 *
 * <h2>The same part, meaning the opposite thing</h2>
 * The player met the crank linkage on the hammer, where the short throw is the strong option
 * because a lever trades distance for force. A bellows wants displaced air rather than force, so
 * the <b>long</b> throw is the useful one here. A component that composes two ways is the first
 * time in the slice that a crank stops being a required adapter and starts being a choice.
 *
 * <h2>Why gearing buys nothing here, which is not a restriction</h2>
 * The linkage multiplies a machine's stated force by the gear advantage and clamps to the
 * machine's ceiling. This machine's ceiling <em>is</em> its long throw, so the clamp bites at once
 * and no gear train ever moves more air per stroke. That is the physics rather than a rule: a
 * bellows holds what it holds, and squeezing it harder does not find more air inside it. So
 * gearing buys force on the hammer and stroke rate here, out of one mechanism, because a ceiling
 * is a property of the machine.
