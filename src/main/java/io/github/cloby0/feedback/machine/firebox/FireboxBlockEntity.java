/**
 * Burns fuel. Produces a flame temperature and nothing else.
 *
 * <h2>It heats nothing</h2>
 * The firebox has no idea what is above it. It publishes how hot it is burning and the vessel
 * reads that -- which is the same shape as every other pairing in the mod, and it is what lets a
 * crucible sit over a firebox, over lava, or over whatever a later slice lights, with no code
 * knowing the difference.
 *
 * <h2>Air is a rate, not a fuel</h2>
 * Blowing does not make the fire last longer or burn more coal; it makes the same fire
 * <em>hotter</em>, which is what air actually does and what the slice needs it to do. A charcoal
 * fire tops out at 1220 Tu, which is below steel's window, so no amount of patience substitutes
 * for air -- philosophy 7's hard gate again, and the reason the bellows is the beat's one verb.
 *
 * <h2>The noise floor lives here</h2>
 * Each piece of fuel is rolled once for quality when it is lit, and burns at that quality for its
 * whole burn. That makes the wandering <em>learnable in aggregate</em> rather than merely jittery
 * (§8): a batch runs hot or cool and the player can feel it and respond. Rolling per tick would
 * be the same variance with nothing to notice.
 *
 * <h2>What burns, and how hot, is data</h2>
 * See {@link FuelTable}. The firebox holds no opinion about charcoal and does not consult vanilla
 * burn times -- a vanilla burn time counts items smelted, which is a fact about a furnace and
 * carries no temperature. An item nobody has written a fuel entry for will not light.
