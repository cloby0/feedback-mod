 * <h2>What a node knows</h2>
 * Very little, deliberately. A node knows its <em>ratio</em> -- how its own speed relates to the
 * network's -- and the Su it supplies or demands. It does not store a speed: the whole run turns
 * as one object, so speed belongs to {@link RotationNetwork} and a node just scales it.
 * <p>
 * That split is what makes momentum possible. Inertia is a property of the entire spinning mass
 * and cannot live in any single block.
 * <p>
 * Derived in design from Create's {@code KineticBlockEntity} (MIT), but much smaller: Create's
 * also carries a behaviour framework, goggle tooltips, sound scapes and a rendering bridge.
