/**
 * The strength of a single application of force -- one blow, one press, one stroke.
 *
 * <h2>Per-application, never a rate</h2>
 * The distinction from {@link Fu} is the one §17 spends the most words on. {@code St} is how hard
 * one blow lands; {@code Fu} is how much has landed in total. A hammer that strikes twice as
 * often delivers twice the Fu at the same St, and a material with a hardness floor above that St
 * takes <em>nothing</em> however long it is hit -- which is philosophy 7's hard gate, and the
 * reason the two are separate units rather than one energy figure.
 *
 * <h2>Where the force goes when it cannot go into the work</h2>
 * A blow geared past what a machine's construction can take is not discarded. The machine absorbs
 * the excess and wears, so St also indexes damage: {@code FTuning.HAMMER_MAX_ST} is a property of
 * the apparatus, and everything above it is condition lost. Wear is caused only by misuse, so a
 * worn machine is evidence of a specific mistake rather than a maintenance bill -- and condition
 * itself is deliberately <em>not</em> a unit, because it is a dimensionless fraction of as-built
 * spec. See {@code CLAUDE.md}: "wear is a percentage, not a unit".
