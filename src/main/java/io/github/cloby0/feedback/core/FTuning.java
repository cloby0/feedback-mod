 * Every tunable number in the mod, in one place.
 *
 * <h2>Why this file exists</h2>
 * Almost none of these figures are defensible yet. Slice 1 fixes {@code Su} for a few machines
 * and never fixes a speed at all, and the philosophy is explicit that exact values are not
 * decided. They will stay fiction until the slice has been played.
 * <p>
 * So the point of centralising them is not tidiness, it is <em>turnaround</em>. Tuning should be
 * editing one list, not hunting through a dozen block entities. When the numbers start to mean
 * something, this becomes a config file; until then it is the single place a playtest note can
 * be applied without reading any code.
 * <p>
 * Anything here marked SLICE comes from feedback_slice_01.md. Everything else is invented.

     * Invented. Bearing friction per shaft, in Su per RPM.

     * <h3>Why loss is Su, and why it scales with speed</h3>
     * Loss is Su rather than RPM because a rigid shaft turns at one speed along its whole length
     * -- a difference between its ends is torsion, not loss -- and what friction consumes is
     * torque. Because Su sums network-wide, loss is automatically distance-independent: moving a
     * machine nearer the generator saves nothing, since every bearing in the run turns either
     * way, including those on a branch nobody uses. Sprawl costs; distance does not.
     * <p>
     * Scaling with speed is what makes it interesting rather than a tax. Three things follow,
     * none of which had to be designed:
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>A stopped shaft costs nothing.</b> An idle network is free, and an unpowered one
     *       is not "overstressed" -- it simply has no load.</li>
     *   <li><b>The network finds its own top speed.</b> It accelerates until surplus torque runs
     *       out, at {@code capacity = drag x rpm}. A long run does not hit a wall and refuse; it
     *       just turns more slowly, because friction ate the torque. This is deliberately unlike
     *       a hard per-shaft Su cap, which produces the absurdity of a generator being <em>too
     *       good</em> for its own shafting.</li>
     *   <li><b>Slow and wide becomes a real alternative to fast and narrow</b>, because speed is
     *       now something you pay for by the block.</li>
