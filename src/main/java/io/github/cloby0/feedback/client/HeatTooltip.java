/**
 * Says how hot the thing in your hand is -- as a word, or as a figure if you own a thermometer.
 *
 * <h2>It needs no packet, which is the stamp design paying out</h2>
 * A workpiece stores the temperature it was stamped at and the tick that happened on, both
 * network-synchronised components, and the client's game time is the server's. So the client can
 * compute the current figure itself, exactly, with no round trip and no per-item sync. A design
 * that stored a live temperature would have needed one of those and would have been stale anyway.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a separate listener from {@link WorkpieceTooltip}</h2>
 * The two are independent facts about a stack and one does not imply the other -- a hot ingot
 * that has never been struck is the normal case at the crucible, and a half-worked plate is cold.
 * Folding them together would mean one early return deciding whether the other line prints, which
 * is how a tooltip quietly stops mentioning heat.
