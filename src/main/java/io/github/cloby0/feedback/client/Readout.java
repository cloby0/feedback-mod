/**
 * The only place the mod turns a simulated figure into something a player is allowed to read.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is one class</h2>
 * Philosophy 8's rule -- senses give adjectives, numbers cost an instrument -- is a rule about
 * <em>wording</em>, and wording duplicated across a tooltip, a HUD and whatever comes next drifts
 * apart until one of them quietly starts printing a figure. Keeping the vocabulary in one place
 * makes the rule enforceable by reading a single file.
 *
 * <h2>What belongs here and what does not</h2>
 * Only <em>state</em>: what a machine is doing right now, which is the half of the information
 * layer that has to be bought. Requirements and equipment specs are free and exact (§8, <em>what
 * you need is free</em>), so they are formatted at their call sites with no ceremony -- there is no
 * rule to enforce about them.
 *
 * <h2>The instrument seam</h2>
 * {@link #instrumented()} is currently "is the player wearing the debug helmet", which is a cheat
 * standing in for a technology that does not exist yet. When calipers and thermometers arrive they
 * do not replace this -- they widen it, because the real question is per-quantity and per-accuracy:
 * <em>what resolution can this player resolve this variable to, here?</em> A boolean is the
 * degenerate case of that question and the call sites are already asking it.

     * need recalibrating. The moment any of that is real, a player looking at a bad batch needs to

     * where the number came from: not from the world, but from a device the player chose to own.
