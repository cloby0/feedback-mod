 * A body has a mass and a temperature that other things change. A fire has a temperature and no
 * mass worth modelling -- nothing the player does cools a fire, they either feed it or they do
 * not. Keeping them apart is what stops the crucible needing to know whether it is over charcoal,
 * over lava, or over something a later slice invents: it asks the block below how hot it burns and
 * has no further opinion.

     * cheaper honesty than wrapping lava in machinery, and it keeps the slice's best joke intact:
