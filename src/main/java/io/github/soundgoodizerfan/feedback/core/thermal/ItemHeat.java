/**
 * The temperature of a loose workpiece -- in a machine, in a chest, in your hand, on the floor.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here is ticked, and that is the whole design</h2>
 * Philosophy 9 says a heated item is hot <em>wherever it is</em>, cooling towards ambient in hand,
 * in a chest, in transit. Taking that literally rules out the obvious implementation. Items are
 * ticked only in a player's inventory and as dropped entities; a chest is not ticked, a hopper's
 * contents are not ticked, and an item passing through somebody else's pipe is certainly not. Any
 * scheme that cools by ticking has a list of places where heat quietly stops mattering, and the
 * player will find that list.
 * <p>
 * So a stack does not store its current temperature. It stores the temperature it was last
 * <em>set</em> to and the game tick that happened on, and the current figure is computed from
 * those whenever anybody asks. Decay is closed-form, so one evaluation is exact however long the
 * gap was, and "wherever it is" needs no enumerating: an ingot in an unloaded chunk, in a dropped
 * stack, or in a mod we have never heard of cools correctly because nothing had to remember to
 * cool it.
 *
 * <h2>Confirmed rather than invented</h2>
 * TerraFirmaCraft stores {@code (capacity, lastTemperature, lastTick)} on its own heat component
 * for exactly this reason. That is convergence on the one approach the problem admits, and it is
 * worth knowing the shape is load-tested rather than clever. Its licence means the code could not
 * have been borrowed even if we had wanted to -- see THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md.
 *
 * <h2>The stacking consequence, which is a feature</h2>
 * Components are part of a stack's identity, so two ingots heated at the same instant to the same
 * temperature merge and two heated a minute apart do not. That is correct -- they are not the same
 * object any more -- and it is why {@link #settle} matters: once a workpiece is close enough to
 * ambient its components are dropped entirely, so it becomes byte-identical to one that was never
 * heated and the player's chest does not fill with piles of one.
