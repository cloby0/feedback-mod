/**
 * The machinery that makes a unit cost one small file instead of a pass over the codebase.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists at all</h2>
 * The standing argument for paying a fixed cost early (see {@code CLAUDE.md}): a high fixed cost
 * paid once beats no fixed cost and a medium variable cost paid per feature, and the crossover
 * arrives earlier than it feels like it will. Four units were enough to make that true here. The
 * mod already knows it wants stored chemical energy, electrical energy in {@code Eu}, pressure in
 * {@code Pu}, amount of substance in {@code Qu} and possibly radiation, and every one of those
 * would otherwise arrive with its own hand-written codec, its own wire format and its own
 * formatting call. Those three things are the actual cost of a unit. The record declaration is
 * the cheap part.
 *
 * <h2>Adding a unit -- the whole checklist</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Write the record. One component, named for the dimension; implement {@link Unit#raw()}
 *       and {@link Unit#unitKey()} in a line each. Copy {@link Su} for a base unit or
 *       {@link Drag} for a compound. Base units name their component {@code value} because the
 *       type name is already the dimension; compounds name theirs for the dimension, because
 *       {@code ThermalMass} and {@code Conductance} are both "a float" until the accessor says
 *       otherwise.</li>
 *   <li>Add its symbol to {@code en_us.json} under {@code feedback.unit.<name>}.</li>
 *   <li>If it appears in a datapack table, take a {@link #codec} or {@link #intCodec} and a
 *       {@link #streamCodec} or {@link #intStreamCodec} here. Do not hand-roll either.</li>
 *   <li>If a player may read it as a figure, add a {@code Quantity} and let
 *       {@code Readout.figure} format it. Do not write a bespoke formatter -- that is how §8's
 *       wording rule drifts.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Nothing has to be registered and nothing has to be edited here, which is the point:
 * {@link Unit} is deliberately <em>not</em> a sealed interface. Sealing would buy exhaustive
 * switches, which nothing wants, and charge a second file edit for every new unit, which is
 * exactly the per-unit cost this class exists to remove.
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately absent</h2>
 * No arithmetic, no conversion, no dimensional algebra. See the package javadoc: the types guard
 * the plumbing, and the physics is written in plain floats unwrapped at the point of use. A
 * conversion table would also be actively wrong for this mod -- {@code Su} does not convert to
 * {@code Eu}, on purpose, and philosophy 4 makes that a design rule rather than an omission.
