/**
 * Lets vanilla hoppers feed and empty a crucible.
 *
 * <h2>It leaks no completion detection, and that is checked rather than hoped</h2>
 * The same argument as the hammer's anvil. An extractor takes whatever is in the vessel, finished
 * or not -- a hopper under a crucible is a second machine racing the first, not a sensor that
 * knows when the steel is ready. That keeps the mod's central claim intact: nothing in it can tell
 * you a process is complete, and building something that appears to is the player's problem to
 * solve with instruments.
 * <p>
 * What a hopper <em>does</em> buy is real and worth having: the player stops standing there. It
 * buys attention, not capability, which is the trade the whole slice is about.
