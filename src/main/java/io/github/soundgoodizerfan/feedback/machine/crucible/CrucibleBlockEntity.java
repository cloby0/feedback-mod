/**
 * A vessel that was designed to be measured.
 *
 * <h2>Why it exists, and why it is worse</h2>
 * The slice's best thermal vessel is the sealed blast furnace, and everything good about it
 * follows from being closed. A carried thermometer can still be dipped through the door for one
 * manual reading -- see {@code ThermometerItem#onItemUseFirst} -- so a sealed vessel was never
 * truly unmeasurable. What it refuses is being <em>watched</em>: no ambient reading, no HUD card,
 * no sensor fitting ever auto-attaching itself to it ({@link ThermalBody#hasThermowell()}). That is
 * exactly what a controller needs and a manual spot check cannot give it, so the player's best
 * vessel and their first automated loop are still mutually exclusive, and no amount of iron fixes
 * it. The way out is not a better furnace; it is a vessel with a hole in it.
 * <p>
 * So the crucible is <b>not an upgrade</b>. It is slower and clumsier than the thing it does not
 * replace, and it is the only one of the two that can ever be part of a loop. What the player
 * buys with it is the option to walk away, which is philosophy 7's possible/reliable/economical
 * distinction arriving as something they feel rather than read.
 *
 * <h2>It knows nothing about steel</h2>
 * The crucible holds items at whatever temperature its fire and its own mass produce. What
 * happens to them is a property of the materials, looked up in {@link ThermalProcessTable}, and
 * the crucible never asks what it can make -- it has no answer. Leave iron in past its window and
 * the vessel does not stop, so the iron burns: the same machine-does-not-know-when-to-stop as the
 * hammer, in the second energy type.
 *
 * <h2>Mass is the whole of the upgrade</h2>
 * The two sizes differ by one number, {@link #getThermalMass()}, and everything the player
 * notices follows from it -- how fast it climbs, how far a twenty-tick-old reading has drifted,
 * whether it can satisfy a process's heating-rate limit at all. Insulation is a second number
 * arrived at by stacking blocks against it. Neither is "+50% anything"; both are things you could
 * point at.
