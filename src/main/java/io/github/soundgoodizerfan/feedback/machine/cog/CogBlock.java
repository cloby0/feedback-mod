/**
 * A toothed wheel. Trades speed for force, or force for speed, and nothing else.
 *
 * <h2>Why gearing matters here and not only as a speed knob</h2>
 * Gearing down multiplies the force behind each blow and divides how often blows fall, so work
 * per second is unchanged -- what changes is whether a single blow clears a material's hardness
 * floor at all, which is the difference between working the material and doing nothing to it.
 * That makes a gear train the <em>second</em> answer to the force problem philosophy §5 asks for:
 * a short crank throw is free but spends precision, since the same hard blow that reaches the
 * threshold also overshoots the state you wanted, while a gear train keeps the gentle blow's
 * control and spends capital and space instead.
 *
 * <h2>Two sizes, and what meshing means</h2>
 * A cog is bolted to a shaft, so it couples along its own axis exactly as a shaft does. Set two
 * cogs side by side in the same plane and their teeth <em>mesh</em> instead: they drive each
 * other, in opposite directions, at the ratio of their sizes. Small to small is 1:1 reversed;
 * large to small doubles the speed; small to large halves it.
 *
 * <h2>Where this deliberately differs from Create</h2>
 * Create requires a large cog and a small one to be placed <em>diagonally</em>, because its large
 * cog is visibly bigger than one block and its teeth reach the corner. Ours mesh face to face,
 * for as long as all the art is placeholder: every block here is a one-metre cube, so a diagonal
 * rule would be one the player cannot see and therefore cannot learn. Revisit when the cogs have
 * real models -- the propagator would need to scan diagonal neighbours, which is the only part of
 * this that is engine work rather than content.
 * <p>
 * The two sizes and their ratios are Create's, taken deliberately. Their code is MIT and the
 * rotation layer is openly Create-inspired; this mod's originality is in overrun and
 * instrumentation, not in inventing a third cog. <b>Their assets are not MIT</b> -- see
 * THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md.
