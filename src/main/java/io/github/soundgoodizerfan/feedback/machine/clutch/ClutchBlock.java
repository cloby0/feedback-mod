/**
 * A shaft coupling that can be let go.
 *
 * <h2>Stopping is its own problem</h2>
 * Philosophy 13 separates sensing from stopping, and gives each energy type its own stopping
 * hardware with its own failure character. For rotation that hardware is a clutch, and its
 * character is that <strong>it does not stop anything</strong> — it stops <em>driving</em>.
 * Whatever was downstream keeps turning on its own momentum until friction takes it, which with
 * a flywheel on the line can be a very long time.
 * <p>
 * That falls out of machinery already built rather than being written here: disengaging splits
 * the run into two networks, and the far one simply has no source. The inertia model does the
 * rest.
