/**
 * Hits whatever is in front of it, forever.
 *
 * <h2>The whole mod, in one block</h2>
 * The hammer has no recipe list and no notion of completion. It delivers {@code Fu} at whatever
 * {@code St} its linkage provides, and it keeps doing that for as long as it is driven. When the
 * workpiece has taken enough work it becomes the next thing along the same physical axis -- and
 * then the hammer carries straight on working <em>that</em>.
 * <p>
 * Copper ingot to plate is the process. Plate to foil is the same process, not a malfunction:
 * foil is a real material the thermometer needs, so the first overrun a player meets is a
 * sidegrade rather than a punishment. Only past foil is there scrap.
 * <p>
 * Nothing here decides any of that. The chain lives in {@link io.github.soundgoodizerfan.feedback.process.DeformationTable} as a property of
 * the material, and the hammer never consults it for anything except "how much work does this
 * need and how hard must I hit it".

     * over-gearing. A hammer battered by beating cold steel went on hitting at its full 12 St,
     * which made two thirds of the wear invisible. Scaling {@link #getStrength} as well means a
     * worn head delivers less of every blow, which is what a mushroomed face actually does.
     * <p>
     * Gearing can then partly compensate for a worn hammer -- up to the ceiling, which has fallen
     * too -- and that is a genuine trade rather than a loophole. Recovering force by gearing costs
     * cogs and speed, and drives the machine nearer a ceiling it can no longer take.
