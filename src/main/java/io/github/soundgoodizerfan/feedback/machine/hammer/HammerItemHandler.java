/**
 * The anvil, as one slot anything can reach into.
 *
 * <h2>Why automating this does not automate completion</h2>
 * A hopper under the hammer takes whatever is lying on the anvil. It cannot ask whether the
 * workpiece is finished, because nothing in the mod can: the hammer does not know what it is
 * making and the item does not announce that it has arrived. So an extractor is not a completion
 * sensor bolted to the machine -- it is a second machine running at its own rate, and the player's
 * problem becomes the race between how fast work goes in and how fast product comes out.
 * <p>
 * That is the whole design working rather than a hole in it. Pull too eagerly and you bank
 * half-worked ingots; pull too late and the plate is foil. Timing the extraction is the same
 * decision as timing the drive, which is what the Clutch and the Timer are for.
 *
 * <h2>Anything may be placed on it</h2>
 * {@link #isItemValid} accepts everything, deliberately. A hammer that refused items it had no
 * process for would be checking identity (§1) and would quietly be a recipe list. It accepts
 * whatever it is handed and hits it; whether anything happens to it is the material's business.
