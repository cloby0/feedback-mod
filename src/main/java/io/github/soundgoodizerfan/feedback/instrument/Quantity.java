/**
 * Something a player might want a number for.
 *
 * <h2>Why measurement is never general</h2>
 * A thermometer says nothing about how flattened an ingot is, and calipers say nothing about how
 * fast a shaft turns. Precision is not a property a player accumulates — it is bought one
 * quantity at a time, and owning one instrument must never quietly sharpen every readout in the
 * game.
 * <p>
 * {@link StringRepresentable} plus the two codecs below exist for
 * {@code control.program.SensorNode} -- a controller program has to know which quantity a wired
 * sensor reads, so a comparator can refuse to compare Su against Tu instead of silently mixing
 * them (controller spec §2.3's typed ports, one level more specific than Number/Boolean).
