/**
 * Draws a rotation node as its own block model, turning.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not decoration</h2>
 * Philosophy 8 says the player's own senses are free and sufficient — that you should be able to
 * walk into a factory and read its state without buying an instrument. Until a shaft visibly
 * turns, that is a claim the mod cannot back: a running network and a dead one look identical,
 * and every question about speed has to be answered by a HUD. Motion is the first readout, and
 * the only one that costs the player nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Why instanced</h2>
 * A shaft run is many copies of one model differing only by position and angle, which is exactly
 * what instancing is for: one draw call for the whole run instead of one per block. The transform
 * is recomputed on the CPU each frame rather than derived from a clock in a vertex shader —
 * slower in principle, and irrelevant at our block counts. Create does the GPU version with its
 * own shaders, which are not ours to take.
 *
 * <p>One class covers every spinning block because {@link Rotatable#getRotationAxis} and
 * The baked model and the rotation axis between them answer everything a rotating visual needs to know: which way
 * it turns, and what it looks like. Nothing here is per-block, so nothing here should be.
