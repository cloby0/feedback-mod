/**
 * Draws a rotation node the slow way, for players who have turned Flywheel's backend off.
 *
 * <h2>Why this has to exist</h2>
 * A spinning block keeps itself out of the chunk mesh, because otherwise the mesh would draw a
 * motionless copy underneath {@link RotatingVisual}'s turning one. That makes the block entity the
 * <em>only</em> thing that draws it — so with the backend off and no renderer here, every shaft in
 * the world would simply disappear. This is not a nicety; it is the other half of leaving the mesh.
 *
 * <p>One draw call per block, which is exactly the cost Flywheel exists to avoid. That is the
 * bargain: correctness without the backend, speed with it.
