/**
 * What it means for a block to accept fittings -- GTCEu's {@code ICoverable}, split for
 * Feedback's three fitting kinds instead of one. See {@code TODO.md} §4d for the read this came
 * from and what was and wasn't kept.
 *
 * <h2>Two storage shapes, because the kinds aren't all sided</h2>
 * A {@link SensorFitting} or {@link AdapterFitting} occupies one face -- at most one of either
 * per {@link Direction}, the same one-per-side rule as a cover. An {@link UpgradeFitting} isn't
 * placed on a face at all, so it lives in a plain list instead.
 *
 * <h2>{@code canMount} is where {@code ThermalBody.hasThermowell()} widens to, not replaces</h2>
 * A sealed vessel already refuses ambient reading via {@code hasThermowell()}; a holder that is
 * also a {@code ThermalBody} should have its {@code canMount} check that flag for
 * {@link SensorFitting}s rather than duplicating the fact in a second place. Nothing in this
 * interface does that wiring itself -- it stays a per-holder decision, the same way GTCEu's
 * {@code canAttach()} is decided by the cover, not by {@code ICoverable}.
