/**
 * An {@link Instrument} that watches instead of being carried -- the bimetallic strip, and
 * whatever eventually reads pressure or load the same ambient way.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is an {@code Instrument} rather than its own reading contract</h2>
 * A sensor fitting and a carried instrument answer the exact same three questions -- what it
 * can read, how finely, and what to call it (§8's significant-figures point doesn't care who is
 * holding the device). What differs is only how each gets its chance to look: an
 * {@code Instrument} is found by {@code Instruments.best()} rummaging the player's inventory;
 * a {@code SensorFitting} is found already attached, by {@link Fittable#getSidedFitting}. Two
 * lookup paths to the one contract, not two contracts.
 * <p>
 * {@code ThermalBody.hasThermowell()} still gates whether a sensor fitting can be mounted at all
 * on a given holder, exactly as it already gates a carried thermometer's passive reading -- see
 * {@link Fittable#canMount} and that method's own doc. A holder that refuses the mount never
 * produces a fitting to read from in the first place.
 *
 * <h2>How a reading actually reaches a controller</h2>
 * A {@link DataNode}, pulled rather than pushed: nothing here schedules a tick or fires an event
 * when the reading changes. Whatever is linked to this fitting -- a controller, or for now the
 * debug controller -- asks {@link #readValue()} when it wants to know, the same on-demand shape
 * {@code ThermalBody} already uses for temperature. See {@code control/data} for the link graph.
