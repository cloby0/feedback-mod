/**

 * on demand rather than cached, the same trade {@code ThermalBody} makes for a workpiece's
 * temperature. A node's identity is a block position plus an optional side: {@code null} for an
 * unsided node (a controller, occupying the whole block), a real {@link Direction} for a sided
 * one (a sensor fitting sitting on one face).
 * <p>
 * MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod: Refurbished (MIT) keys its electricity nodes by {@code BlockPos}
 * alone -- one node per block entity. Feedback widens that by one field because a fitting is
 * sided and a holder can carry several at once (up to six sensor fittings on one crucible); see
 * {@code TODO.md} for what else was and wasn't taken from that read.
