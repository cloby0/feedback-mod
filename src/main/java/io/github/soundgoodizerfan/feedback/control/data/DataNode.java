/**
 * Something that can be linked to another one, invisibly, with the data connector -- no cable
 * block, nothing in the world but the two endpoints. Philosophy's own §"how data gets to the
 * controller" already committed to no wire being a real thing in the world; this is that
 * paragraph, typed.
 *
 * <h2>Read from MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod: Refurbished (MIT), and what changed</h2>
 * {@code IElectricityNode} is the shape this is adapted from: a capability the holder implements,
 * a set of connections it owns, default connect/disconnect/search methods. Left behind
 * deliberately: {@code isSourceNode}/power/overload -- a data link never carries current, it just
 * lets a reading be asked for, so there is no "powered" state and nothing to overload. Also left
 * behind: the GPU frame-graph renderer that draws nodes and wires through walls. That mod targets
 * a newer Minecraft than Feedback's 1.21.1 and uses a render pipeline (a separate texture target
 * composited over the world) that doesn't exist on this toolchain -- the visible-with-tool-in-hand
 * overlay is real content but a different implementation, and isn't built yet (see
 * {@code TODO.md}).
 * <p>
 * Widened from the original: a node's identity is {@link #getNodePos()} <em>and</em>
 * {@link #getNodeSide()}, not position alone, because a {@link Fittable} holder can carry several
 * sensor fittings -- one per side -- each its own node. An unsided node (a controller) answers
 * {@code null} for its side.
