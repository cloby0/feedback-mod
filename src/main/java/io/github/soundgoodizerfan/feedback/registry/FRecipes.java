/**
 * The mod's one crafting-table recipe serializer, and it is likely to stay the only one.
 *
 * <p>Feedback's processes are datapack tables rather than {@code RecipeType}s, on purpose -- a
 * machine that owned a recipe list would know when it had finished, which is the one thing this
 * mod's machines must never do. What lives here is the exception that proves it: hand work, where
 * the crafting table is vanilla's recipe machine and the player is the one who decides to stop.
