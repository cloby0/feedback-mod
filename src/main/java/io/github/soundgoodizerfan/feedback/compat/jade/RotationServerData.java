/**
 * Sends the truth about a rotation network to the client so the HUD can describe it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this goes through Jade rather than the block's own sync</h2>
 * A {@link RotationNode} already syncs enough for rendering, but not enough to be honest with. The
 * Su ledger it carries is a snapshot from the last time the network was recalculated, and target
 * speed and inertia are network-wide and never sent at all. Adjectives could be derived from the
 * stale figures and would usually be right; the debug helmet could not, and philosophy 8 is
 * explicit that an instrument may become wrong but may never overstate its certainty.
 * <p>
 * So the numbers are fetched live, on demand, for the one block the player is looking at -- which
 * is what Jade's server data is for, and costs nothing when nobody is looking.
 * <p>
 * The consequence worth knowing: on a server without Jade installed, no data arrives and the HUD
 * says nothing rather than guessing.
