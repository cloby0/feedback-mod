/**
 * Puts the deformation table and the thermal process table in the recipe browser without
 * pretending either is a recipe book.
 *
 * <h2>No vanilla recipe type, deliberately</h2>
 * JEI's {@code IRecipeCategory<T>} is generic over any type at all, so a category can be built
 * straight from {@link Deformation} -- which means the mod never has to register a vanilla
 * {@code RecipeType}, never appears in the recipe book, and never acquires an API that would let
 * something ask the hammer what it can make. The hammer genuinely does not know; a compatibility
 * layer that implied otherwise would be the mod lying about its own central claim.
 *
 * <h2>Why the recipes arrive late</h2>
 * JEI starts its runtime from the vanilla recipe sync, which lands during the configuration phase,
 * while our table arrives on datapack sync in the play phase. So {@code registerRecipes} would
 * almost always see an empty table on a first join, and adding there as well as here would produce
 * every card twice. Pushing once, from the runtime, is the version with one code path.
 * <p>
 * {@code hideRecipes} before each push is what makes a second push idempotent: a {@code /reload}
 * can deliver a fresh table without JEI restarting, and without this the old cards would linger
 * alongside the new ones.
 *
 * <h2>One tab for both, not two</h2>
 * A first pass gave the pooled vanilla/modded cooking recipes their own category and their own
 * tab. Wrong call: they are the same question {@link ThermalProcessCategory} already answers --
 * what a fire does to a material -- and a second tab just for "we didn't author this one" is a
 * distinction the player has no reason to care about. {@link ThermalProcessTable} entries and
 * pooled ones are both wrapped as a {@link ThermalProcess} and published under one
 * {@link ThermalProcessCategory#TYPE}. See {@link #pooled} for how a pooled recipe is turned into
 * one without inventing figures nobody wrote down: it only ever carries the two universal floors
 * every vessel already enforces, {@link FTuning#METAL_MIN_TU} and {@link FTuning#FOOD_MAX_TU}.
 *
 * <h2>Vanilla's own categories are hidden here too</h2>
 * The Furnace, Smoker and Blast Furnace never touch a vanilla block class any more (§4f), so
 * JEI's built-in smelting/blasting/smoking categories describe blocks that no longer exist in a
 * normal playthrough.
