/**
 * Hooks the mod's readouts onto Jade's HUD.
 *
 * <h2>Jade, carefully</h2>
 * A HUD that printed {@code 14.3 RPM} on a bare shaft would hand over the instrument layer for
 * free and gut philosophy 8. One that says <em>turning slowly</em> until an instrument is installed
 * is not a compromise with that rule, it <em>is</em> that rule, on a HUD. See the individual
 * providers for which lines are free and why.
 * <p>
 * This class is loaded only by Jade's own plugin scan, so nothing here runs when Jade is absent.
