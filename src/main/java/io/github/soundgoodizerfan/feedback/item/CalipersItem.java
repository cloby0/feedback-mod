/**
 * Turns "kinda flattened" into a figure.
 *
 * <h2>An instrument that refines rather than reveals</h2>
 * The player could always see a workpiece flattening — beat 1 deliberately ships no measuring
 * tool, because eyes are sufficient for *avoiding* scrap. What eyes cannot do is <em>aim</em>.
 * <p>
 * Calipers exist because of the overrun band: foil is a genuinely useful material sitting in a
 * narrow window past plate, and hitting that window on purpose every time is the first thing in
 * the game that needs a number rather than a glance. So this is a yield technology and not a key
 * (§7). It unlocks nothing. It improves a conversion ratio, which is why anyone buys it.
 * <p>
 * It matters that this is the weaker of the slice's two instruments and arrives first. When the
 * thermometer turns up it will reveal a quantity the player cannot perceive at all, which is a
 * much larger event — and it lands harder because calipers already taught what an instrument is
 * for.
 *
 * <h2>Why holding it is enough — for an item</h2>
 * No right-click to read a workpiece. Applying calipers is a real action, but on something the
 * player is already holding it is a keystroke with no decision inside it, and §3 cuts mechanics
 * that are real, well-precedented and simply not fun. Holding them is the same information at the
 * same price.
 * <p>
 * <b>That argument is about items and does not extend to machines.</b> Reading a machine's wear
 * means getting down and putting the instrument on it, and a running hammer cannot be measured --
 * so the reading costs a stopped line, and there is a genuine decision in whether to pay it (§5).
 * The rule §8 states is about price rather than object: <em>a reading is passive when taking it
 * is free, and an action when taking it costs something.</em> One instrument, both behaviours,
 * and it is the same measurement either way -- a mushroomed head is a piece of metal that has
 * deformed, which is what calipers were already for.

     * <h3>Why this runs before the block gets the click</h3>
     * NeoForge's {@code onItemUseFirst} is called ahead of any block interaction, which is the
     * only seam that works here: a hammer's own right-click accepts whatever is held as a
     * workpiece, so without this the first thing a player measuring a hammer would do is forge
     * their calipers into a plate. Taking the click here also means no machine block needs to know
     * that instruments exist -- a second wearing machine costs nothing.
     *
     * <h3>Server-side, and that is not a formality</h3>
     * Condition is only synced to the client when the <em>adjective</em> would change, because
     * wear happens blow by blow and a packet per blow would say nothing new. So the client's copy
     * is stale by up to a whole band, and a five-per-cent reading taken from it would be fiction.
     * The figure is read where it is true.
