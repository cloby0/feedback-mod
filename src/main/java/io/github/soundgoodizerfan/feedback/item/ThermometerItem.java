/**
 * Copper foil, a sealed tube, and something that expands.
 *
 * <h2>An instrument that reveals rather than refines</h2>
 * This is the larger of the slice's two instruments and it arrives second, which is the right way
 * round. Calipers refine a thing the player could already see -- a workpiece was visibly
 * flattening before they owned any -- and they exist to let the player <em>aim</em>. The
 * thermometer reveals a quantity the player cannot perceive at all. The word "hot" is the entire
 * vocabulary they had, and steel's window is 60 Tu wide.
 * <p>
 * The order matters because calipers already taught what an instrument is for. Arriving first,
 * this would have looked like a key.
 *
 * <h2>It is immediately, obviously insufficient</h2>
 * 25 Tu of resolution against a 60 Tu window means the player can be at 1425 or 1450 or 1475 and
 * cannot tell which. And it is still enough to work by hand -- heat, look, wait, look, adjust --
 * miserable, slow, and it produces steel reliably enough to be worth doing.
 * <p>
 * That is the progression moment, and nothing was unlocked. The recipe was never locked; what the
 * player lacked was never heat (§7). They gained <em>information</em>, and information became
 * capability. A better thermometer later buys significant figures, not access.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is carried rather than attached</h2>
 * Same argument as the calipers: reading is passive and costs no hands. The slice's wall -- that
 * the player's best vessel cannot be <em>automated</em> against -- is not enforced by making this
 * a cover, but by the vessels themselves, through {@link ThermalBody#hasThermowell()}. It gates
 * the ambient, continuous reading a HUD card or a future cover would give for free; it is a fact
 * about the vessel rather than a rule about this item, and it stays true for every instrument we
 * ever add.
 *
 * <h2>Sealed is not the same as unreadable</h2>
 * {@link #onItemUseFirst} lets a carried thermometer take one manual reading of any {@link
 * ThermalBody} at all, sealed or not -- the same shape as {@code CalipersItem} reading a wearing
 * machine: a real action, taken by walking up and touching the thing, priced by costing a click
 * rather than by being refused outright. What a seal still buys the vessel is that nobody is
 * watching it for free; it says nothing about whether the player standing in front of it right
 * now can dip a probe through the door.
