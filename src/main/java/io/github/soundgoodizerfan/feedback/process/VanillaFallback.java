/**
 * Philosophy 15's fallback: the compatibility shim that lets the Furnace, Smoker and Crude Blast
 * Furnace attempt any vanilla or modded cooking recipe, so that reworking the three of them
 * cannot make a single existing recipe uncraftable.
 *
 * <h2>Whitelists come off here, on purpose</h2>
 * Vanilla keeps three separate recipe types -- {@code smelting}, {@code blasting},
 * {@code smoking} -- as a stand-in for "which appliance this belongs in". §15 says that stand-in
 * has to go: nothing may declare the Smoker a food machine or the Blast Furnace an ore machine,
 * three numbers in {@code FTuning} do that instead. So every vessel searches all three recipe
 * types for a match on its own input, and whichever one exists is a fact about the <em>item</em>,
 * never about which block it happens to be sitting in.
 * <p>
 * A recipe's type is still read once it is found, but only as a thermal hint: {@code
 * tpu_spec_doc.md}'s "Vanilla Recipe Types Become Thermal Hints" reads {@code smoking} as
 * food-like (low, stable heat, a real spoil ceiling), {@code blasting} as metallurgical (rewards
 * a hotter environment, no food-style ceiling), and {@code smelting} as the generic default --
 * three suitability curves in {@code FTuning}, never a machine check.
 *
 * <h2>Do not let the shortest recipe win</h2>
 * An earlier version of {@link #find} picked whichever of the three matching recipes had the
 * shortest declared cooking time, once, and ran that recipe forever -- which made an ore's
 * blast-furnace time win in every vessel, including a plain Furnace that can never reach
 * blasting's optimum. {@code tpu_spec_doc.md} calls this out by name: that turns a vessel's
 * emergent specialisation (§15) into a hidden recipe rule. This version instead evaluates every
 * matching type's suitability against the vessel's <em>current</em> temperature, every tick, and
 * runs whichever one is actually thriving there -- so an iron ore's blasting profile only wins in
 * a vessel that is actually hot enough to be near it, exactly the way the smoker and blast
 * furnace are already supposed to specialise without either block knowing the other exists.
